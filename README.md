# MAZE SOLVER
- The project is about building a ME (Maze Solver) application using Java language.
- The ME solver is a 2D grid with a starting and ending point, and the goal is to find the shortest possible path between them.
- The technologies used are Java, JavaSwing, JFrame.
- The grid will have different colored blocks, white blocks represent obstacles, and black blocks are the ones through which the path can go.
- The project will have a business logic algorithm responsible for finding the path.
- The GUI of the application will be built after the business logic.
- The focus will be on the GUI, which should be visually attractive and user-friendly.
