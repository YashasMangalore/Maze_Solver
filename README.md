# Maze Solver Project

This project is a Java implementation demonstrating maze solving using the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm.

## Description

The project comprises the following components:

- `DFS.java`: Contains the implementation of the DFS algorithm for maze solving.
- `NewClass.java`: Main class that visualizes the maze and the path using Java's Swing library.
- `README.md`: This file providing information about the project.

## Getting Started

To run this project, ensure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

1. **Clone this repository** to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/YashasMangalore/Maze_Solver

2. **Navigate** to the project directory: cd Maze_Solver/tree/master/src/main/java/com/mycompany/maze_solver_project
 
3. **Compile** the Java files: javac NewClass.java

4. **Run** the project: javac NewClass.java

## Usage

Upon running the project, a window will display the maze and the path found by the DFS algorithm. The maze grid uses the following conventions:

- Black squares: Walls.
- White squares: Empty spaces.
- Red square: Starting and ending points.
- Green squares: Path from the starting point to the destination.
- The DFS algorithm finds the path from the starting point to the destination (marked as '9').
